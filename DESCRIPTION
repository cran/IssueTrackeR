    milestones. It includes functions for storing, prioritizing (sorting),
    displaying, adding, deleting, and selecting (filtering) issues based
    on qualitative and quantitative information. Issues (labels and
    milestones) are written in lists and categorized into the S3 class to
    be easily manipulated as datasets in R.

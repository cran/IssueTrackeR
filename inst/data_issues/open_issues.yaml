  We observe what appears to be a bug.

  ### Description

  When reloading a data file in the Providers tab, new series are added to the open SA-Processing.

  ### Procedure

  1) Open JDemetra+ v3.5.1
  2) Create a new WS
  3) Create a new SAP
  4) Add data from Providers to SAP
  5) Add new points to data file
  6) Re-add the data file under Providers (even if already present and with star)
  7) Click on "Reload"
  8) Series are added again to SAP

  Here's a short video describing the procedure:

  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323a11ee-9949-467d-8f43-79b4cdf8ab3b
- "Issue #489 is unresolved. \nThe problem remains in version 3.5.1. \n\nAlso, the
  SI ratio display is still different and appears with Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 :\n\n<img width=\"605\"
  height=\"255\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49948a60-a027-4bed-8947-9e9eedc49537\"

  It would be very interesting to add ways to retrieve WS file names and paths.

  Is it possible to add methods like `getSource` and `setSource` to be able to retrieve the file containing a SA-Processing, a SA-Item or even a Workspace directly from the Java object?

  Thank you
- "Hello, \n\nI'm opening an issue but it's more of **a discussion**.\n\nFirst of
  all, the WS structure contains:\n\n- data (calendar, regressors and data), \n- statistical
  models (specifications) \n- and outputs. \n\nIn the context of moving to a cloud-native
  solution and changing JD+ to a web API, would it make sense to review this structure?\nI'm
  wondering about this too, because it's a recurring remark that was at the origin
  of @AlessandroPiovani's project ([RJDprocessor](https://github.com/AlessandroPiovani/RJDProcessor)).\n\nAlso,
  in the context of online services via compute servers or virtual machines (see [SSPCloud](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr)
  we are using at Insee), does this structure fit in well with modern statistical
  processes?\n\nFinally, how can WS be managed with **Git** directories? Should WS
  be pushed or not, or only the models?\n\nThanks"
- "### Introduction\n\nIn JDemetra+ v3, it's not possible to refresh a SA-Item with
  **Right click** > **Refresh** when the newly created WS is not saved.\nIt was possible
  to refresh a new WS in version 2.\n\nBut there is A way to refresh a SA-Item with
  concurrent policy with the GUI in version 3.5.0 with a newly created WS is not saved.
  Just by changing the `domainSpecification` like in #733 \n\n### My questions\n\nIs
  there a way to refresh a SA-Item newly created in v3.5.1?\n"
- |+
  ### Intro

  In the latest v3.5.1, there is a *breaking change* with v3.5.0 regarding the specification handling.

  ### Step to reproduce

  1) Open JDemetra+ v3.5.1
  2) Create a new WS
  3) Add a series (with for example RSA3 specification)
  4) Change the `domainSpec` (**Right click** > **Edit** > **Reference specification** > **Select...** > RSA5 (for example)

  ### Conclusion

  The `domainSpec` is changed but not *applied*. So, the **Current spec** is still **New** and not **Concurrent** as in v3.5.0

  Is it a bug? I don't see any mention of it in the CHANGELOG and is it intended?

  Consider importing a CSV file in the Providers panel and specifying an incorrect date format (such as using 'mm' rather than 'MM', where the former specifies minutes and the latter specifies the month):

  <img width="462" height="501" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fac7b3d-29cd-4078-81a3-1876b076f251" />

  After attempting to include some of the imported data in a new Vars document via the Workspace panel, the JD+ GUI becomes glitchy and unresponsive (the Vars-1 window is stuck on the 'Drop data here' prompt, and preview/mouse-over content from the Providers panel clashes with the prompt and won't disappear):

  <img width="874" height="583" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c13d973-b719-4621-b389-d2e9fb9b50ec" />

  As another example, the screen shot below shows how the Providers panel remains with the contents of the Workspace panel after attempting to switch to it:

  <img width="207" height="197" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/430b6688-c429-4dfa-8e66-9cab84812313" />

  It would be nice if the GUI would more gracefully handle invalid importation to improve the user experience (whether the date format is mis-specified, or anything else is mis-specified, such as TAB rather than COMMA for the delimiter value, for example).

  To recover in this situation, I essentially have to restart the GUI and lose any unsaved changes. I would suggest this behaviour is a bug, rather than being suggestive of an enhancement.

  This is just a question:

  Are there any character restrictions imposed by the JDemetra+ GUI and/or the Cruncher when naming series (that is, when providing a name or ID for series)? For example, are certain special characters not allowed, or are there any character-length limits, and do these differ for the GUI vs the Cruncher?
- "I've found a bug with the cruncher. \n\nHere's the output I saw at the end of my
  run: \n- At the end of the output printed out by cruncher was this: (note the 'failed'
  line)\n```\nFlushing bundle...\nGenerate Output\nCsv matrix\nfailed: Input length
  = 1\ncsv\ngenerated\nSaving new processing...\n```\n- output series were produced
  as normal\n- the demetra_m.csv file is missing most of its content. Up to a certain
  series X, it is written to as normal. But the row for series X abruptly stops printing
  output midway through. The several rows that were most recently printed are then
  printed twice more, starting at midway through the series X row (presumably these
  were the contents of the buffer), always stopping abruptly at the same point in
  the next series X row.  This meant most of the series had no matrix output at all.\n\n\nUsing
  a debugger, I could see that the issue was an **UnmappableCharacterException**,
  which occurs when you try to write a valid character into a file using a character
  set that does not contain that character. The exception only occurs when the buffer
  with that character is flushed. It happens in the CsvInformationFormatter class,
  and the chosen character set is visible in the CsvMatrixOutput class. Both are in
  the jdplus.sa.base.csv package.\n\nThe issue is that the infinity character ∞ is
  not valid in the chosen character set [ISO/IEC 8859-1 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1#Code_page_layout)\n\nThe
  cell that gets an infinity result is **diagnostics.fcast-outsample-variance** in
  series X. If I remove that the from parameters file, cruncher runs as normal with
  no issues.\n\nI tried removing every series except series X, and I got the same
  output in the demetra_m.csv file, except that the rows were only printed twice,
  not thrice. So this can be reproduced with just one series.\nI also tried removing
  just series X from the full workspace, and it ran as normal with no issues. So the
  diagnostic works in most situations, just not for this series.\n\nI suggest you
  do one of the following things to fix the issue:\n- Change the character set used
  for CSV output to one that includes the infinity character\n- Change the custom
  number formatter to print a double 'infinity' value as the string \"infinity\" instead
  of as \"∞\"\n- If infinity is not a valid result for the diagnostics.fcast-outsample-variance
  test, change it so that it can't end up with infinity\n\n\nI don't need this fix
  urgently- it turns out that I don't need fcast-outsample-variance so I've just removed
  that from the parameters file."

  I changed the reference specification from RSAfull to x11 and then the specification wasn't changed:

  <img width="991" height="603" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/719f1e55-d3f6-4c3e-9d54-6ac304e7a84e" />

  1. Step run a seasonal Adjustment

  <img width="1028" height="703" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/259b11fd-dece-4ac6-b37b-b2a4a7335d6c" />

  2. Drag and Drop a series

  <img width="988" height="364" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f21f58fe-90d7-44b0-98f0-91c20e3cb1b8" />

  then the Series is doubled, and buggy
- "Please find enclosed the example for a user-defined trading day. The output could
  be generated with the cruncher or with output in the UI for a SaProcessing. \nIn
  the output in \"ahaCN_GP14\\SAProcessing-1\\demetra_m.csv\" for ahaCN_GP14, the
  regression.ntd is 1 but the column E and F for the variables are empty. In Version
  2 ntd=0 and the columns are also empty. \n\n\n\n[ahaCN_GP14.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21258003/ahaCN_GP14.zip)"
- |-
  All fixed and non-fixed (estimated) outlier corrections can be conveniently seen in the Pre-processing panel. However, the information displayed for each type (fixed vs non-fixed) differs. In the example screen shot below, non-fixed (pre-specified) outliers have the type and period shown, but not the name; whereas for fixed outliers, the name is shown, but not the type and date:

  <img width="910" height="491" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/287b2ddc-990f-4de8-86f2-84109dc1ebf6" />

  Also note: https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/issues/590: it would be better if 'Prespecified outliers' was labelled 'Non-fixed outliers' instead in the Pre-processing panel. 'Coefficients' does not need to be pluralised by the way, as the entry for each row reflects a single coefficient; it should just be 'Coefficient'.
- "Hi,\n\nWe have noticed that when a series that has regarima.transform.function
  = 'Log' cannot be logged (for example, if it has 0s or negative values in the original
  series), the Cruncher automatically converts the transform function to 'None'.\n\nAre
  you able to confirm that this is the only situation in which the Cruncher would
  change the user specified transform function (excluding if it is set to 'Auto',
  of course)? \n\nSimilarly, would Cruncher ever change x11.mode from the user specified
  mode?"
- |-
  For series with many pre-specified outliers, the left-hand panel of the 'Pre-specified outliers' dialogue box does not allow scrolling to see the entire list:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3e5ade3-02b4-4b05-8d45-9d694812433b)

  Fortunately, any non-visible outliers can still be navigated to using the arrow keys, but clearly this behaviour is not ideal and a scrollbar should be added.
- |-
  Hi,

  When I set my (monthly) series and model span to only the last 36, 37 or 38 periods, the 'Combined seasonality tests on sa' and 'Combined seasonality tests on sa (last years)' don't appear in the Main results part of the GUI:

  Main results with longer series and model spans:
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b154c104-cf58-4c8f-ba55-9b9e4248b45c)

  Changed the series and model spans:
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89d0ad4b-385a-4bf6-869b-87bba53bddf5)

  Main results with 36 periods for series and model spans:
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8a60344-295a-4bfb-9ffd-21ba6ce692ca)

  Is this a bug or is it expected due to how the combined test for SA is calculated?

  Also, does the (last years) in the Main results part of the GUI refer to the most recent 3 years (as in the demetra_m output), or the most recent 10 years (as in the Seasonality Tests Diagnostics part of the GUI), or something else? It would be helpful if this was explicitly labelled.
- |-
  We would like to suggest the following feature request that will improve the user experience:

  The JD+ GUI does not provide an explicit error when the operation to save a workspace file has failed. Instead, the operation fails mostly silently, which misleads the user into thinking that their workspace has saved successfully.

  For example, when saving a workspace to a read-only location, there is no explicit feedback to the user to state that the workspace has in fact not been saved, and the experience is indistinguishable to a save operation that has succeeded. The only implicit feedback is via the error icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen. We have detected two related errors for this scenario:

  Ideally, a pop-up message box would appear (with far more user-friendly text than what appears in the images above) and alert the user to the failed save operation when attempting to save to a read-only location, so that they can be aware of this fact and then save the workspace in an alternative location with write-access.

  This scenario is highly relevant for us, since we have many non-sophisticated users of JD+ who are unfamiliar with operating the GUI and in knowing where to save their files, and who will likely ignore the error area in the bottom-right corner of the screen (noting that we have encountered a number of errors that seem irrelevant to the user and will therefore be overlooked by them due to frequent irrelevancy).

  The message could say the following, for example: `Error! You've attempted to save to a read-only location, so the workspace has not been saved. Choose a different location with write-access to save the workspace in.`

  If there are other possible reasons for not being able to save a workspace besides saving to a read-only location, then ideally they should also be accounted for.

  (Similarly, a more explicit message or indication could perhaps be provided when a save operation is successful (via either 'Save' or 'Save As', so that in the absence of it, the user becomes alerted to something having gone wrong. But for failed save operations, an explicit message is preferred.)

  We can study 3 different cases of data:

  - ts without metadata
  - ts with metadata
  - ts with false metadata

  In these 3 cases, the seasonal adjustment works, but the refresh only works for the first 2 cases and generates an invalid for the last case.

  **Is this a deliberate behaviour?**

  here is my R code:

  ```r
  library("rjd3toolkit")
  library("rjd3workspace")
  library("rjd3providers")
  library("rjd3x13")

  data_path <- system.file("data", "IPI_nace4.csv", package = "rjd3workspace")
  ts_object <- txt_series(
      file = data_path,
      series = 1L,
      delimiter = "SEMICOLON",
      fmt.date = "dd/MM/yyyy"
  )
  ts_object2 <- txt_series(
      file = data_path,
      series = 2L,
      delimiter = "SEMICOLON",
      fmt.date = "dd/MM/yyyy"
  )

  my_ws <- jws_new()
  my_sap <- jws_sap_new(my_ws, "new_sap")

  add_sa_item(my_sap, name = "air_with_ts_metadata", x = AirPassengers, spec = x13_spec())
  add_sa_item(my_sap, name = "air_with_wrong_ts_metadata", x = AirPassengers, spec = x13_spec())
  add_sa_item(my_sap, name = "air", x = AirPassengers, spec = x13_spec())
  set_ts(my_sap, 1, ts_object)

  ts_object2$moniker$id <- ts_object2$moniker$id |> txt_id_properties() |> txt_to_id()
  set_ts(my_sap, 2, ts_object2)

  save_workspace(my_ws, "tmp.xml", replace = TRUE)

  library("rjwsacruncher")
  options(
      cruncher_bin_directory = "path/to/jwsacruncher-3.5.0/bin/",
      v3 = TRUE
  )

  cruncher_and_param(workspace = "tmp.xml", policy = "complete", log_file = "cruncher.log")
  ```

  Also, the [cruncher.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20576914/cruncher.log) isn't very informative and doesn't give any details about the fact that the adjustment is failing for the second SA-Item.

  Is it possible to move (up or down) an SA-Item in an SA-processing?

  I'd like to reorganise my SA-Items so that they follow a certain nomenclature (a certain order).
  I'd like to do this in R but I haven't found any other method than creating a copy of my WS and transferring my SA-Items one by one in the order I want.

  My questions are as follows:

  - Is it possible to do this with the GUI (outside R)?
  - Is there another method in R?

  Thank you.

  When you create a WS with variables and the variable name contains one or more spaces, JDemetra+ no longer knows how to distinguish variables from their name and you end up with more variables than you expected and incorrect variables.

  Here's an example of my tests on video:

  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c27dd99a-6acb-447b-826b-76f98b72b7da

  I think it's either a bug or a shortcoming in the GUI warnings and in the documentation.
- |
  In JDemetra+, there is a precise vocabulary for distinguishing objects.
  **Names are important** and some terms are unfortunately synonyms and can refer to the same object.

  I suggest grouping the names together to obtain one name = one object.

  Here's my list:
  | Current name                                                                  | Suggested name                            |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
  | Reference specification --> 2nd column of the table + right click on a series | Domain specification (domainSpec )         |
  | Current spec (3rd column of the table)                                        | Policy                                    |
  | Specification (panel on the right)                                            | Estimation specification (estimationSpec ) |
  | Multi-document / Multi-Processing                                             | SA-Processing                            |

  In R, there is also a `result_spec` item which corresponds to `pointSpec`:

  ``` r
  mod <- rjd3x13::x13(AirPassengers)
  names(mod)
  #> [1] "result"          "estimation_spec" "result_spec"     "user_defined"

  Currently in a SA-Processing there are SA-Item and each SA-Item can contain a `<item name="metadata">` section with (currently only) the `<item name="comment">` item.
  I understand that the role of this section is to add information that are not related to the adjustment but we want to keep.

  But could we include in this section more information. For example:

  - the `priority` item (#611) which is not directly related to the adjustment
  - the `quality` item which is an output from the model (and not useful to adjust the data)
  - the `policy` item which is also an output (and which is not used to refresh the data when the cruncher is called again, for example #483)
  - any other item we want to add to our SA-Item

  In the package **{rjd3workspace}**, I would like to add a function `put_metadata()` to add (or update) any new metadata (key, value) to SA-Item (but also SA-Processing and WS).

  In JD+ v3.4.0, I can copy a series and paste it into a chart container using the `Ctrl` + `V` keyboard shortcut. This works whether the chart container is empty, or whether it contains series already.

  For grid containers however, the keyboard shortcut does not seem to work unless the user activates an existing column by clicking on a row within it. This therefore means that the user cannot use the keyboard shortcut directly on an empty grid container, because there is no column to be activated.

  In the screen shot below, I have highlighted the two areas on a grid corresponding to my explanation above: the red area is what the user must click on first to allow the keyboard shortcut to work; the blue area doesn't seem to work, although it does work for chart containers (that is, I can click anywhere in a chart container to activate it, and then the keyboard shortcut will work; and so I don't have to click on an existing series for the shortcut to work).

  A provider node has no children if no datasource has been defined and/or restored.
  Double-clicking on it in this state doesn't do anything.
  Currently, the user must right-click the provider node to add a new source.
  The idea is to check if the provider node has no children on double-click and, if so, add a new source directly.

  For series in a multi-document, it's not immediately obvious to the user what the periodicity or frequency of the series is. After processing an individual series and clicking on its row, the 'Main results' tab appears and the user can tell the frequency by the x-axis labelling of the SI chart as highlighted in red below. This is an unnatural and slower way though of discovering the frequency of a series.

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d28f6949-140f-4ab9-89c6-c1dc018b648e)

  It would be ideal if the Summary section just said explicitly 'Quarterly series' or something similar as indicated by the arrow in the screen shot below:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21b48667-fea7-409b-a422-b52fd604f8d4)

  Note that the span of the series as per the line 'Estimation span: [12-2008 - 12-2003]' is not especially helpful either, because for some dates, like 3-2008, this could refer to either the March month of monthly data, or the March quarter of quarterly data. (Note #489 which would assist here; for example, 'Q3 2008' is clearer for quarterly data than '3-2008'.)

  Consideration could also be given to having a new column to display the frequency of each series as indicated by the arrow in the screen shot below:

  When renaming User-defined variables through the following menu, I can sometimes rename variables to the same name, and other times I get an error message.

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2b30a7e-cc26-44c0-9b71-4fb3c7b8bb95)

  Here, I attempted to rename Headline_impute_2qtrs to Headline imputation and received this message:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/199e4a64-7a82-4d09-a051-164ab26e61f4)

  Here, on the other hand, I have successfully renamed Vars-2 to Vars-1, even though there is already a Vars-1 variable.

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88867422-10fc-4ac1-a14b-4155f37bec2c)

  In this case, the filename remains as Vars-2, as shown in the workspace XML file:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0966a121-9155-41f7-9311-7391cc001469)

  Also in this case, the name used in the selection of User-defined variables to apply to a series remains as Vars-2:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b19b23f2-3ae4-45a1-8b24-7c834a79a1e8)

  Even within the same Workspace I get inconsistent results when attempting to rename a variable to the same name as another variable. To be clear, I don't want to have two variables of the same name - I am trying to determine what validation JD+ does to prevent this.

  I also wonder what the purpose of the 'name' of the variable is, as opposed to the 'file' name. It appears the _name_ is only used for display in the Utilities section of the Workspace tab, but the _file_ is used to link variables in the XML files (i.e. to specify which user-defined variables are applied to a series in the SAProcessing file). If this is the case, is it possible to rename the variable _file_ as opposed to the _name_?

  In the JD+ GUI, the user can insert 'pre-specified outliers' as shown below, and these can be fixed or non-fixed:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4a65a9a-3173-4e67-80a3-1e1f4cdd7ee7)

  If the user then looks at the **Summary** section of the **Main **results**** section in the output area for the series, the labelling for these pre-specified outliers is confusing:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13e3bb60-a0f3-4905-839c-5ece0d7bc286)

  In this summary section, the fixed outliers (only) have been separated out. But because it firstly says '2 pre-specified outliers', it seems as though there are only 2 in total. However, all types of outliers, whether fixed or not, should be deemed 'pre-specified outliers', because they must be specified by the user in advance.

  It would be better to display the information similar to below:

  ```
  3 pre-specified outliers
  2 non-fixed [or say 'estimated' instead]
  1 fixed
  ```

  There should also be a newline between 'No easter effect' and '2 pre-specified outliers' in the example above to further improve comprehension of the information about outliers.

  Note there is further confusion when auto-outliering is enabled. If I switch it on for the example above, it now seems there are only 2 outliers: 1 that is detected, and 1 that is fixed:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3b8fb2f-3b4f-4359-a43e-f99854d16f38)

  My suggestion is as follows (noting importantly the newlines):

  ```
  4 outliers total

  1 detected outlier [or say 'automatically inserted' instead to be clearer; 'detected' means 'identified', it doesn't mean 'identified and corrected']

  3 pre-specified outliers
  2 non-fixed
  1 fixed
  ```

  If newlines aren't acceptable, then perhaps the following is best (that is, just ignore the fixed vs non-fixed distinction):

  ```
  4 outliers total
  1 automatic outlier
  3 pre-specified outliers
  ```

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b39d481f-62e7-4f93-92fa-ad1d6db9e733)

  If the series is processed, it will successfully run:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8a3dd02-a767-41ca-afd6-92d17422ccd3)

  Now consider renaming the regressor via the 'Vars-1' document by changing the name from 'x_1' to 'x_1_changed':

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d55d1c4-d173-4e90-84f8-2b317f7324e1)

  After renaming it, the operation _appears_ to have been successful in the 'Vars-1' document:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6285d0a0-b87e-480e-8e0f-c9faeb1318da)

  If the series is reprocessed _but no other changes are made_, it will 'successfully run' again:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8a3dd02-a767-41ca-afd6-92d17422ccd3)

  However, if any _other_ change whatsoever is made to the series (such as changing the 'Tolerance') and then the series is processed, it will not run successfully:

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f45838b-c7ed-48a0-84d3-414cb8ccc22d)

  If the name of the regressor is changed back to 'x_1' from 'x_1_changed', _whether or not other changes are made_, the series can be processed and run successfully again (here, instead of changing the tolerance, 'Preliminary Check' was unticked):

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1b7cc15-982d-4fc3-8d34-f0a9f7e2c701)

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/771e6df7-b348-448b-b9d3-166b6ed88c0c)

  The above steps prove that the backend of the GUI is not correctly registering a change in the name of a regressor permanently.

- "Hi JDemetra+ devs,\r\nWe are using cruncher v3 in a data processing application
  implemented in Java. At a high level we are calling jdplus.cruncher.App.main with
  a valid workspace and parameters file, then parsing the output files for consumption
  by downstream services.\r\nOne issue with cruncher is that in most cases it does
  not produce any exceptions or logs when any of the SAItem.process calls fail, so
  we cannot know when/why a cruncher run failed (other than by seeing if it produces
  an empty output file).\r\n\r\n**The cause seems to be as follows:**\r\nCruncher
  hardcodes the \"verbose\" param in this SAItem process call to false: https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/blob/develop/jdplus-main-cli/jdplus-main-cli-bin/src/main/java/jdplus/cruncher/batch/SaBatchProcessor.java#L89\r\nThis
  causes cruncher to use a DummyLog rather than the DefaultProcessingLog class - https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/blob/develop/jdplus-main-base/jdplus-toolkit-base-parent/jdplus-toolkit-base-api/src/main/java/jdplus/toolkit/base/api/processing/DefaultProcessingLog.java\r\n\r\n**Feature
  request**\r\nWould it be possible to update cruncher with the following changes:\r\n1)
  allow users to parameterise cruncher to use \"verbose\" logging (i.e. log errors
  DefaultProcessingLog)\r\n2) return the content of the ProcessingLog to the user

  a refresh policy can also be specified for each individual series in its corresponding
  workspace file. For example, in a multi-document containing a group of series, each
  one can have its own revisions policy specified (via the GUI), such as the first

  the single one provided in the Cruncher parameter file? (Does the Cruncher accept
  per-series policies?)\r\n\r\nFor example, does the parameter file policy act as
  a global policy that overrides any individual series, or conversely, is it ignored

  the 'Configure...' context menu when right-clicking on it. This brings up a dialogue
  box with an option to change the 'Color scheme'. However, the different colour options
  are not presented as a user-friendly drop-down list. Instead, the user must somehow
  know in advance what the options are and start typing letters to see the colour
  options appear. (And if the 'wrong' letters are typed, then the options shown to
  the viewer are limited.) There shouldn't be a need to type; the user should merely
  just select one option from the list of all possible colour schemes.\r\n\r\n- Another
  issue is that the name of the colour option changes once it is clicked on. For example,

  - Dark' (second image below).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/assets/110582146/6f94b807-acce-4d5d-ab1c-9d0f8c02092b)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/assets/110582146/3e18e9e5-84ea-469f-886d-6fa8a8b40056)\r\n\r\n-

  selection field is prepopulated with the text of the default colour scheme, but

  to single-click to select an option, rather than have to double-click. (For example,
  when selecting the 'Line thickness' in the same dialogue box, only a single-click

    Just to add some additional information:

    1. Still happens in the develop branch
    2. Seems to duplicate only the last added items (last transfer) when the corresponding data file is reloaded
    3. Only happens once, so if you reload the same data file multiple times only one set of duplicates is added
    4. No new data is needed in the data file and it doesn't matter if you add any data files to the provider (Step 5 and 6)
    5. Seems to be related to the events fired in InternalTsProvider (so not only xlsx shows this behaviour)

    Ok, I will try the new dev version! Thank you

    Since the issue is still valid until a new release is made I leave this issue open.

    Hi just to clarify, you mean the file representation of a workspace or do you mean the complete structure of JDemetra with SaItems, TsVariables, ModellingContext? Changing the latter would mean a total redesign of JDemetra, the former is just one implementation of WorkspaceRepository and can be replaced even while the JDemetra application is running.
    A web API would be designed mostly from the ground up but in the end the data and statistical models still need to be provided by the user.

    To Git: We commit the whole Workspace.
  - |-
    Hi everyone, the structure I’m proposing in my package is not meant to replace the existing workspace (its structure remains unchanged) but rather to provide something that can be extracted from it.
    In practice, I extract the specifications from the workspace and store them in a JSON file. A workspace can also be rebuilt by merging the specifications and the data back together.

    I’m implementing everything in R, but doing the same in Java would not be an issue. I also noticed that in JD+GUI (v2) there’s something similar, where specifications can be extracted into .cfgx files, but in my opinion JSON offers a more readable format.

    <img width="557" height="670" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9f70d9d-03bd-48fd-84ca-b77095842556" />

    You can find more details about my project here: https://github.com/AlessandroPiovani/RJDProcessor/blob/main/RJDProcessor/doc/package_description/IPS964_AlessandroPiovani_v2.pdf [IPS964_AlessandroPiovani_v2.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22871353/IPS964_AlessandroPiovani_v2.pdf)
  - "Hi @AlessandroPiovani, \n\nTo import and export specification in R, you can use
    the functions from {rjd3workspace} `x13_write_spec` and `x13_read_spec`.\n\n[Exporting
    to `.cfgx` files](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/issues/81) is obsolete,
    and working with XML files is very convenient (both human-readable and machine-readable). "
  - "Thank you @Immurb for your reply. Okay for Git, we're thinking about it at Insee
    too.\n\nI don't want to totally overhaul JDemetra+ of course ^^. \n\nMy question
    was more: \nGiven that we'll have to create a web API for JDemetra+, what's the
    future for the WS structure and to what extent will we have to separate models,
    data and output? "
  - |-
    Since the XML workspace (file representation) is in the jdplus-main-desktop part, I would expect it to be only relevant for the client software and stay relevant there.
    The web API will have another representation for workspace, if it has one at all. But that depends mainly on the functions provided by the web API.

  - "Hi Tanguy,\n\nThere was a bug in 3.5.0 related  to the domainSpec/estimationSpec
    (see #639).\nYou can now change the domainSpec without changing the estimationSpec
    (and of course the opposite). By design, a change of the domainSpec is not applied
    on the estimationSpec, but you have a command to do it. \nI hesitated to apply
    it automatically, for instance because we don't always want to change immediately
    the model. So, I kept the most flexible solution. But we can modify that behaviour
    in different ways (applying it always, applying it in new processing...). \nTo
    be discussed..."
  - |-
    OK thanks Jean.
    What is the command to apply the `domainSpec` on the `estimationSpec`?

    I thought it was the **refresh** operation but it's disabled for WS newly created.
  - |-
    It is only available in 3.5.2 (dev).
    See below

  - 'Thanks for this @Blassik. Yes, we would like the `demetra_m` file issue fixed,
    but to be clear, we would also like to know if there is an issue with calculating
    variances regarding `diagnostics.fcast-outsample-variance`, similar to the out-of-bounds
    exception that was identified as the cause of the bug we raised in: https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/issues/368'
  - "@Blassik : Thanks a lot for informing us of the problem. Could you send the series
    that generated it (if necessary, make a workspace that contains the series + spec
    + additional information and put it in a zip file);  I will take a look. \nAnyway,
    I will adapt the formatter to avoid that kind of problem."
  - "Hi @palatej \nHere's a zip that you can use to reproduce the issue. I've included
    a parameters file and minimised that and the SaProcessing file as much as possible\n\n[Infinity-series.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21461982/Infinity-series.zip)"
  - "Thank you for the series. \nThe problem is clearer now: the series is short and
    deterministic. Normally, the processing is stopped by some preliminary checks
    in that case, because it generates numerous numerical issues. However, you deactivated
    those tests (be careful in that case).\nI will introduce some additional tests
    to avoid as much as possible the computation of  meaningless diagnostics (for
    instance when the standard deviation of some regression is 0, which was the case
    in the out-of-sample diagnostics used in your example).\nAnyway, as mentioned
    above, I will check for NaN in the output."

    It may be linked to  #639. But in reverse.
    I think you need to refresh your model to apply your domainSpec to your series.

    I don't see any benefits in making the specific items less specific, or do you have a use case in mind?

    I think adding a function to the R Package could be beneficial, is it not easily accessible at the moment?

    P.S. We at the Bundesbank use the metadata in v2 at the moment for a lot of plugin specific information e.g. in the CompRes plugin for specifying where to find old factors, and plan to use them again.
  - |
    I don't want the items to be less specific but just put them in the metadata section, where they'll maybe fit better (keeping there item names).

    It's more a question / general comment than a suggestion.
  - |-
    I have two comments on the metadata
    - The metadata are probably underused for the time  being. The use case of the Bundesbank is surely a good example of what we could do.  Adding functions to manage them in R is surely a good idea. You can indeed put what you want in metadata. However, we should avoid putting information available elsewhere: quality, priority, policy are already defined in SaItem (ensuring coherence could become complex)
    - I am not convinced by the use of the metadata to specify the refreshing policy. Refreshing policies are linked to different steps in the production chain: for instance, we refresh everything once every two years and we just refresh a few information (parameters, coefficients...) every month; that doesn't depend on the series. Series with different lifetime should be grouped in different workspaces. But of course, you a free to develop your personal approach...

    > However, we should avoid putting information available elsewhere: quality, priority, policy are already defined in SaItem (ensuring coherence could become complex)

    I wasn't thinking of copying the information but rather of moving it into metadata.

    Hi Anthony,

    I use it to come back from a zoom ...
    (it might have other purposes as well, though ;-)

    Anna
  - |-
    Thanks @annasmyk for the tip. That's the one thing I didn't try! Indeed, it can be used to zoom back out.

    (Perhaps the button could be disabled in the right-click context menu when already zoomed out to make this clearer, or it could be labelled as 'Zoom out' instead.)
  - we should call it "reset zoom"

  - "Thank you for your detailed explanation.\nThe current behavior is \"by design\".
    So it's not an actual bug. However, it can be misleading and I will change a few
    details and/or add messages if need be.\n\nSome explanations:\n1. There is no
    connection between the SA specification and the user-defined regression variables
    (including calendars). If you change those variables (name or content), the SA
    processing is not modified (too complex and error-prone, with many side effects).
    I will not change that choice.\n2. JD+ often uses caching. The results of each
    SA processing is cached in a multi-document. If you re-run the multi-processing,
    any series already processed will be skipped. Suppose that you just add one series,
    it could be expensive to re-process all the other series. Of course, if you change
    something in a spec, the corresponding item will be re-computed. \n \nI see two
    simple solutions: either to provide a function to clear any series already processed
    (so, you will be able to re-compute them) or to force re-processing. The first
    one is more flexible (you could change other things before processing), but it
    needs two actions to recompute everything. Of course, we can provide both solutions.\n\nAn
    additional tool that could be useful: providing the list of the SA items that
    use a given user-defined variable or calendar. Much more complex and not for the
    short term.\n"
  - 'Another remark (related to a previous issue): information on missing regression
    variables explaining why a series can''t be processed will be provided in the
    next release, with other error messages'
  - 'I put a (very partial) solution in the version in dev : you can now reset the
    processing of selected SA items (and of course apply the "run" button or the start
    menu item to re-compute the processing. So, you don''t need to modify an option
    to see the impact of the renaming or of changes in your variables. So, it will
    be available in 3.4.1 (coming soon)'
  - |-
    Hi @palatej. Thanks for your prompt reply and helpful explanations. We appreciate the situation better now.

    We can see merits to both of your simple solutions. Admittedly, we have set up our new system to only use a single series per multi-document (for various reasons too complex to explain here), and so for us, option two (force reprocessing) is preferable because it will not be too resource-intensive in our situation. However, your first simple solution (clear already processed series) is also reasonable and we appreciate the use cases for it.

    The best solution (for us), and arguably from a user experience perspective, is your long-term solution in which a list of SA items that use a given user-defined variable is provided, and better yet, is used automatically to reprocess those series.

    In the meantime, your (very partial) solution in the version in dev should suffice in the short-term.

    However, your solutions above we think will still not address the related issue in: https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/issues/385. Is it possible to have that issue fixed as well so that any changes to Variables documents (that do not correspond to changes in the SAProcessing file) can be saved in isolation?

    Regarding the inclusion of information on missing regression variables and other error messages, we very much look forward to this new feature.
  - 'I skipped #385. I see the problem. It will be corrected in the next release (3.4.1)'
  - 'Thanks @palatej. Please also note new bugs we discovered yesterday that may be
    related to the above, as raised in: #591 and #592.'
  - Ok. I see the problem. To be noted that the name of a group of variables is not
    necessary the name of the corresponding file (names are not always valid file
    names, especially if we consider different platforms). An old choice that generates
    many questions...
  - |-
    Thanks again for implementing a solution to this issue @palatej. The below is just a suggestion for your consideration:

    Perhaps instead of 'Start' and 'Re-run', the labels 'Process new series' and 'Process all series' might be clearer regarding their functions:

  - "Hello!\r\n\r\nI will describe what happened with JDemetra+ 2.x.x.\r\n\r\nWhen
    Tramo model was not decomposed by Seats, one of the approaches used in the production
    of OFFICIAL seasonally adjusted data was based on the manual identification of
    a decomposable model (sometimes the model used by Seats was initially imposed
    and then improved).\r\n\r\nWith the partial concurrent approach a decomposable
    model was preferred for two reasons:\r\n1) forecasts of unadjusted series (in
    Tramo) and forecasts of components (in Seats) were consistent;\r\n2) we were 100%
    sure that seasonally adjusted data were generated through the same model.\r\n\r\nTo
    corroborate item 2): let us think of a time series whose model M1 does not admit
    a decomposition. M1 is then \"approximated\" with a different model M2. Adding
    a new observation, M1 coefficients change and now M1 admits a decomposition. This
    can generate large revisions (or larger than usual).\r\n\r\nHave the previous
    issues been overcome with the new JD+ 3.x.x.?\r\nIf yes, my previous request can

    else before the v3 output dictionary is produced.\r\n\r\n[v3ParameterFileTesting.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18030824/v3ParameterFileTesting.xlsx)\r\n\r\nNote
    that I only tested with one set of series, so it's likely that some of the keys
    that didn't work for me (e.g. trading day keys, backcasts) do actually work but
    weren't relevant for my series.\r\n\r\nThe keys I tested came from:\r\n- the default
    parameter file generated by cruncher when it's run without a parameter file\r\n-
    the v2 output dictionary\r\n- the v3 cruncher and RJDemetra columns from the spreadsheet
    in this ticket https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/issues/394\r\n\r\nThe **Worked**
    column shows keys that I confirmed can produce output- for <matrix> keys, they
    produced output in the relevant column in the demetra_m.csv file, and for <series>
    keys, they produced a csv file which contained output. The column is in alphabetical
    order and I haven't specified where I found each key.\r\n\r\nThe other columns
    show keys that didn't work and where I got them from. I removed a few keys which
    didn't work that were obviously renamed between v2 and v3. For example arima.th
    became arima.theta, and the a/b/c/d/e were moved under a different parent, so
    I didn't include them in the v2 column. \r\n\r\nAlso, there are a couple items
    in red on the first sheet- these ones didn't even produce a column header in demetra_m.
    That surprised me, because putting in random text still produces a column header.
    This may be a bug?"
  - "Just a short comment on the red items: They are \"array\" types. They only create
    column if there is at least 1 entry for them. For example, if there are trading
    days it outputs regression.td(1), regression.td(2) and so on.\r\n\r\nWe will add
    an option to the cruncher to output the used dictionary with classes and descriptions.
    It is pretty much the parameters written in the default params file with some
    extra information.  "

    Then you can choose between None, Legacy, Smooth or Ratio.\r\nThe different corrections

    decompositions?\r\n\r\nIf so, then the bias parameter appears in the underlying
    XML file even if I select a multiplicative decomposition (with a log transform);
    why is that the case?\r\n\r\nIn the Specifications panel, I selected 'Log' for
    'Function' under 'TRANSFORMATION', and selected 'Multiplicative' for 'Mode' under
    'X11' (first screen shot below). However, there is no option to select the setting

    screen shot below).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c33f1b64-a374-4465-b745-e0c093c40cbd)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25168684-ef8a-4b4f-9326-16c7cdf499de)"
  - "You probably had LogAdditive selected once. The bias correction is then set to
    **Ratio** and because that is not the default (**Legacy**) it is then always saved.
    I'm not sure why Ratio is selected by default but Legacy is the default for saving.
    Nonetheless the parameter is only used inside the Kernel if it is LogAdditive,
    seasonal and the parameter is not None:\r\nhttps://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main/blob/0af1f27f818106dda82cc0f0b0d87808f21046cb/jdplus-main-base/jdplus-x13-base-parent/jdplus-x13-base-core/src/main/java/jdplus/x13/base/core/x11/X11Kernel.java#L168-L175\r\n\r\nWe
    should remove it from saving to xml, if the mode is not LogAdditive."
  - "The fact that the parameter is saved in xml will not generate any problem; there
    are other unused parameters that are saved in xml because they differ from their
    default values. To avoid misunderstanding, they should indeed be removed. I just
    corrected the code for this one.\r\nWe provide several bias corrections because
    the original one (\"legacy\") gives sometimes very strange (seasonal) results.
    The \"ratio\" method is exactly what is used in TramoSeats and the \"smooth\"
    is experimental. A methodological point that should be improved in future versions..."
  - Thanks @Immurb and @palatej for your helpful replies. Yes, I had selected log-additive
    at one stage during my session, then switched to a different decomposition, and
    then noticed that the XML file was populated with the corresponding tag forever
    more, which I thought was strange behaviour. Thanks for clarifying that it will
    not impact the series even if it appears in the XML file.

  - "For the logo, we should hire a professional designer...\r\nWhat do you think
    ? @annasmyk @ChristianeHofer @palatej @clemasso"
  - The "logo that appears on some sites" wasn't already done by a professional designer?
    I thought it was supposed to be the official JDemetra+ logo, as I understood it
    was discussed and approved by the SACE in 2017.
  - I do remember some discussion about the logo but nothing else ... maybe I was
    absent at the related meeting.
  - For the different links I think a fast and simple solution would be to have github
    pages in the same organisation (and to move the documentation to github.com/jdemetra)

    and decomposition_d_tables_d10a are both available to be choosen, but in the final
    output only decomposition_d_tables_d10 is explicitly in the file. The forecasts
    from decomposition_d_tables_d10a are added to the decomposition_d_tables_d10 series
    without explicit note."

  - "Changing the decimal separator is not implemented yet but technically possible.
    In the current release, the locale defines the decimal separator.\r\nTo make it
    changeable, one could replace using the locale with using the settings from the
    cruncher’s params file (or its default settings) in the formatter classes. This
    would also affect some functionalities of JD+ which contain creating (csv) output
    files. \r\nIf some users made use of changing the locale for some reason (that
    is doable, e.g. with a plug-in), those functionalities would possible create a
    different output file than expected. \r\nTherefore, it needs to be discussed when
    to use the locale and when to use an individual specification before the code
    is altered.    \r\nBesides, we found that the number of decimals ndecs from the
    params file is not applied correctly: In the DoubleFormatter class “9” is hard
    coded as the max number of decimals, so both the locale and the params settings
    have no influence."
  - "Currently, in my opinion, the problem is also that the decimal separator changes
    the column separator. If your local is a comma, then the exported file when you
    choose \"CSV\" or \"CSV matrix\" is not anymore a CSV file. \r\nMoreover, being
    able to fix/change the decimal separator would improve the reproducibility of
    software results"

    in the interface ("if false only the name of the series will be displayed")
